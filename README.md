What I learnt:
- Creating a simple dashboard
- Displaying objects onto the frontend
- CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) functions in Django
- Connecting PostgreSQL to database
- More confidence in full-stack developing.

What I am still stuck on:
- Serving media files in Django on a hosted site (I can do it when it was on my localhost *seekadvice)
