What I learnt:
- Creating a simple dashboard
- Displaying objects onto the frontend
- CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) functions in Django
- Connecting PostgreSQL to database
- More confidence in building a simple full-stack web app.

What I am still stuck on:
- Serving media files in Django on HEROKU (I can do it when it was on my localhost)
